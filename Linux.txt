What is computer  --> IP enabled device
ex:laptop, washing machine,tv etc.,

1.How to create a server in aws:
consider your home is a server :
so for our home we need key and lock system for security and gate .
so for server also we need security as firewall and key and lock as key-pair . 

so go to any drive in laptop ex: C or D disks and 
1.create a folder for storing and generating all the private keys.
2.open GitBash go to that path 
3.ssh-keygen -f <filename>   ex:ssh-keygen -f daws-86s
	It will ask passwords dont enter anything just enter 
4.do  ls command so that we can get public and private keys files - 
5.open the .pub  (public file) with notepad and copy lines properly for importing key-pair in aws ec2.
6.we need to create a security group -- firewall creation 
	ex:like gate for our home  
Firewall consists of Inbound and Outbound rules. and name the security group for identification
7.create aws EC2 instance by selecting the key-pair and network settings as - Select existing security group
8.How to connect to our linux server
by using  ssh -i <private-key> <username>@<IpV4 address of the linux server>

/root is the working directory of root user
/home/ec2-user is the working directory of normal user
Basic linux commands:

command <inputs> <options> 

~ is the landing of normal user
$ is the representation of normal user
# is the representation of root user

sudo su ---> is the command for acting as root user
sudo su - ---> is landing to super or root user working directory that is (/root) folder
exit ---> is the command to come back from root user to normal user
--help  ---> gives all the options for a particular command

touch ---> used to create a file ex: touch linux-notes.txt
cat > <fileName> ---> used to put the content in that file but previous content will be replaced by present content
			(Usage : cat > <fileName>  , enter text , enter , ctrl+d)

cat >> <fileName> ---> used to put the content with previous content

mkdir ---> used to create a directory or folder
rmdir ---> used to delete a directory

rm -r ---> used to delete the files in the directory

grep --->  used to search the context in the file ("global regular expression print.")

cp --->(copy) copy and paste the file or directory
cp <source(file or folder)> <destination>

mv --->(move) cut and paste 
mv <source(file or folder)> <destination>

rename --->
mv sourceFile editedSourceFile .
. ---> represents the current directory

wget ---> used to download the text file 
wget <text-url>

curl ---> display the text file content on screen without download
curl <text-url>

echo ---> command is used to print
echo "DevSecOps Phani"

cut ---> It is used to cut some portion in any url etc., or cut command can delimit the text and give us the required fragment
for these we use cut command along with -d (delimit) and seperator and  fragement 
echo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daws-86s/notes/refs/heads/main/session-03.txt | cut -d "/" -f1

awk ---> is also act as the cut but some powerful
echo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daws-86s/notes/refs/heads/main/session-03.txt | awk -F "/" '{print $1F}'
awk -F "/" '{print $1F}' ---> first part 
awk -F "/" '{print $NF}'  ---> last part


vim editor : - Vi Improved Editor
---------------------------------

vim <fileName> ---> command for using vim editor for the files
1. if file already have , it will open
2. if file does not have, then it will create it and open

While using Vim editor we need to remember 3 modes
1.Esc mode (Escape mode)  - Default mode is esc mode.
2.i mode (Insert mode)
3.: mode (colen or commad mode)

colen or command mode common commands:-
---------------------------------------

:wq ---> (write & Quit) after the content entered in file for saving the content we use :wq
:q ---> just quit without saving any changes
:q! ---> content doesnot save and quit

:/<search-text> ---> It will search from top to bottom
:?<search-text> ---> It will search from bottom to top

:set nu ---> It will set the numbers at the first of each line in the file
:set nonu ---> It will stop displaying line numbers .

:<line-number> ---> the curser will navigate to that line

:<line-number>d ---> the curser will delete the line

:noh ---> no highlight of text

:<line-number>s/<before-text>/<after-text> ---> used to modify any word or text from before to after and 
						it will modify only first occurance in that line.
ex:-  :56s/course/COURSE

:<line-number>s/<before-text>/<after-text>/g ---> used to modify any word or text from before to after and 
						it will modify all the occurances in that line for that word or text
ex:-  :56s/course/COURSE/g

:%s<line-number>s/<before-text>/<after-text>/g  ---> It will modify all the occurances in the file 
ex:-  :%s/course/COURSE/g



Esc mode (Escape mode):-
------------------------
u (undo) ---> undo the changes in the file
ctrl+r (redo) ---> redo the changes in the file

dd ---> deletes the line [In Ecs mode]
:29d ---> deletes the line [In Colen or command mode]

yy ---> copies the line
p ---> paste the line below
shift+p ---> paste the line above

head <file-name> ---> display first 10 lines in that file
tail <file-name> ---> display last 10 lines in that file

     1  line-1
     2  line-2
     3  line-3
     4  line-4
     5  line-5
     6  line-6
     7  line-7
     8  line-8
     9  line-9
    10  line-10
    11  line-11
    12  line-12
    13  line-13
    14  line-14
    15  line-15
    16  line-16
    17  line-17
    18  line-18
    19  line-19

If we want 5 to 10 
head -n 10 <file-name> | tail -n 6   (simple formula :-  10 - 5+1 )

Linux Administration:- 
----------------------
User Management: - 
* User
* Group
* Role
* Permission

1.Create user
2.Remove user
3.Create group
4.Remove group
5.Add user to group
6.Remove user from group

useradd <user-name> ---> This command will add the user 
groupadd <group-name> ---> This command will add the group

Note: while executing these commands , the normal user will not able to add these so we need to switch as root user 
	with the command sudo su - , 

id <user-name> ---> This command is used to check the user is added or not or (user information)
ex: id sivaphanikumar
uid=1001(sivaphanikumar) gid=1001(sivaphanikumar) groups=1001(sivaphanikumar)

Note: 1.when we create any user the linux will create user with specific userId(uid) and at the sametime and it will create 
	a group with the same name , it is called default group.
      2.If we create any user in linux, he must have atleast one primary group and atleast one secondary group
That'why if we observe   
	uid=1001(sivaphanikumar) gid=1001(sivaphanikumar) groups=1001(sivaphanikumar)
	here gid=1001(sivaphanikumar) - > primary group
	     groups=1001(sivaphanikumar) - > secondary group

cd /etc/passwd ---> If we want to see all the users information .
cd /etc/group ---> If we want to see all the groups information
cd /etc/shadow ---> If we want to see the passwords of users (But in a encrypted format , we cannot see in decrypted format)
