1.How to create a server in aws:
consider your home is a server :
so for our home we need key and lock system for security and gate .
so for server also we need security as firewall and key and lock as key-pair . 

so go to any drive in laptop ex: C or D disks and 
1.create a folder for storing and generating all the private keys.
2.open GitBash go to that path 
3.ssh-keygen -f <filename>   ex:ssh-keygen -f daws-86s
	It will ask passwords dont enter anything just enter 
4.do  ls command so that we can get public and private keys files - 
5.open the .pub  (public file) with notepad and copy lines properly for importing key-pair in aws ec2.
6.we need to create a security group -- firewall creation 
	ex:like gate for our home  
Firewall consists of Inbound and Outbound rules. and name the security group for identification
7.create aws EC2 instance by selecting the key-pair and network settings as - Select existing security group
8.How to connect to our linux server
by using  ssh -i <private-key> <username>@<IpV4 address of the linux server>

/root is the working directory of root user
/home/ec2-user is the working directory of normal user
Basic linux commands:

command <inputs> <options> 

~ is the landing of normal user
$ is the representation of normal user
# is the representation of root user

sudo su ---> is the command for acting as root user
sudo su - ---> is landing to super or root user working directory that is (/root) folder
exit ---> is the command to come back from root user to normal user
--help  ---> gives all the options for a particular command

touch ---> used to create a file ex: touch linux-notes.txt
cat > <fileName> ---> used to put the content in that file but previous content will be replaced by present content
			(Usage : cat > <fileName>  , enter text , enter , ctrl+d)

cat >> <fileName> ---> used to put the content with previous content

mkdir ---> used to create a directory or folder
rmdir ---> used to delete a directory

rm -r ---> used to delete the files in the directory

grep --->  used to search the context in the file ("global regular expression print.")

cp --->(copy) copy and paste the file or directory
cp <source(file or folder)> <destination>

mv --->(move) cut and paste 
mv <source(file or folder)> <destination>

rename --->
mv sourceFile editedSourceFile .
. ---> represents the current directory

wget ---> used to download the text file 
wget <text-url>

curl ---> display the text file content on screen without download
curl <text-url>

echo ---> command is used to print
echo "DevSecOps Phani"

cut ---> It is used to cut some portion in any url etc., or cut command can delimit the text and give us the required fragment
for these we use cut command along with -d (delimit) and seperator and  fragement 
echo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daws-86s/notes/refs/heads/main/session-03.txt | cut -d "/" -f1

awk ---> is also act as the cut but some powerful
echo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daws-86s/notes/refs/heads/main/session-03.txt | awk -F "/" '{print $1F}'
awk -F "/" '{print $1F}' ---> first part 
awk -F "/" '{print $NF}'  ---> last part
